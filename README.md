# Sum-Of-Nodes-In-A-Binary-Tree
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children.The buildTree function first constructs the binary tree from the given preorder traversal vector, using -1 to denote NULL nodes. The main function then calls sumOfNodes on the root of the constructed tree, which returns the total sum of all node values
